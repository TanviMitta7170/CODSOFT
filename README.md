# Artificial Intelligence Projects

This repository contains the projects I have done while learning about Artificial Intelligence.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Tic-Tac-Toe AI (Task 2)
An unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe agent built using the **Minimax Algorithm**.
- **Tech Stack:** Python
- **Features:**
  - Implements Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning for optimization.
  - Impossible for a human to beat (always wins or ties).
  - Terminal-based interactive gameplay.

### 2. AI Image Captioning (Task 3)
A Deep Learning model that generates descriptive captions for images.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, PyTorch, Transformers (Hugging Face)
- **Model:** Vision Encoder-Decoder (ViT + GPT-2)
- **Features:**
  - Uses a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) to analyze images.
  - Generates natural language descriptions using GPT-2.
  - Can process any user-uploaded image.

### 3. Face Detection System (Task 5)
A real-time face detection system using Computer Vision.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, OpenCV
- **Features:**
  - Real-time detection via webcam.
  - Customized Haar Cascade parameters to reduce false positives in complex backgrounds.
  - Draws dynamic bounding boxes around detected faces.
